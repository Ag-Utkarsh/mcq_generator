Monkey D. Luffy, commonly known as "Straw Hat Luffy" or simply "Straw Hat",[10] is the founder, captain, and strongest combatant of the increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates.[26][27] He fearlessly pursues the legendary treasure of the late Gol D. Roger in order to become the new Pirate King[28] and reach a further, untold dream (currently known to only his crew, family and closest friends).[29][30] He believes that being the Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world.[31]

Born on Dawn Island, Luffy is the son of Revolutionary leader Monkey D. Dragon[32] and grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp[33] and as such is a member of the Clan of D. Most of his childhood was shaped by Garp and Curly Dadan,[34] under whose care he befriended and swore brotherhood to the late Portgas D. "Fire Fist" Ace[35] and Sabo.[36] However, he draws his greatest inspiration from the pirate "Red-Haired" Shanks, who (unwittingly) enabled him to eat the Devil Fruit that turned his body into rubber,[37] sacrificed an arm to save his life, and gifted his signature straw hat as a symbol of their vow to reunite someday, after Luffy became a great pirate.[38]
